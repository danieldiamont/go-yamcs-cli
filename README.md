# CLI tool for Yamcs data extraction to csv files

This is primarily a learning project for me, but may prove useful in the future with some more work put into it.

For a fully functional Yamcs client application that is supported by Yamcs Mission Control and can be used to build your own CLIs in Python, please refer to the [python-yamcs-client](https://github.com/yamcs/python-yamcs-client). This repo is not affiliated in any way to Yamcs Mission Control.
